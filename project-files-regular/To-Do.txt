Defensive Agent
- Split up (if risky exit occupied, find other one)
    - If another offensive agent, find its risky exit
    - Else, find second risky exit for lone offensive agent
- If food on border, guard against quick grabs
- Do we want to be more proactive, chase away from border?
    - Pros: Less food on border
    - Cons: Possible defensive holes
- Power pellets. What do?
- Possible distraction plays?


Offensive Agent
- A*? tbh depends on if we wanna blitz for early points or what
- Most likely will need defensive agent to push in at same time as offensive to provide distraction/confusion
- Risk feature of more pellets = time to return (Kinda done)
- How to play around our power pellet? (Working Better)
- Maps to focus on later:
    - 43825 (Winning state, but doing really stupid moves)
    - 8746 (Winning state, but playing too defensively, and killing self at same time)
    - 86243 (Winning state, but playing too risky, goes into dead ends when enemies far away, but doesn't cash in on it)
    - 51249678 (Barely winning state, literally stuck at the border for 80% of the game)
    - 5437 (Barely winning state, turns into a loading wheel)



- Also, we could ask Daniel & Navin if they wanna test our agents against each other. Either way, its happening in the tournament. But if we learn off of each other, we both go higher.
