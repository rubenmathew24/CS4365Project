Defensive Agent
- Split up (if risky exit occupied, find other one)
    - If another offensive agent, find its risky exit
    - Else, find second risky exit for lone offensive agent
- If food on border, guard against quick grabs
- Do we want to be more proactive, chase away from border?
    - Pros: Less food on border
    - Cons: Possible defensive holes
- Power pellets. What do?
- Possible distraction plays?


Offensive Agent
- A*? tbh depends on if we wanna blitz for early points or what
- Most likely will need defensive agent to push in at same time as offensive to provide distraction/confusion
- Risk feature of more pellets = time to return (Kinda done)
- How to play around our power pellet? (Working Better)
- Maps to focus on later:
    - 4903
    - 1492
    - 2923 (winning state, but does a really stupid move)
    - 4900


- Also, we could ask Daniel & Navin if they wanna test our agents against each other. Either way, its happening in the tournament. But if we learn off of each other, we both go higher.
